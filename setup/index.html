      <p>The bright November Sunday after my brother's memorial service near Chicago, I packed up my rented Corolla, not with books or pictures or baseball mitts or the other expected knickknacks of the dead, but with musical gear: a classical guitar, a newly purchased Stratocaster, two amplifiers, a box of pedals and effects, a drum machine, a four-track tape recorder, and a microphone. Instead of spending the better part of this last summer writing, I spent it sorting through that equipment, testing the cables for shorts, figuring out which knobs do what, even composing song fragments on my computer.
