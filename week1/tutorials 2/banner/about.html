            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>As an educator, I believe in the power of hands-on learning and practical application. My teaching philosophy centers on making complex concepts accessible and engaging for students of all backgrounds. I specialize in web development education, helping students build both technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities.</p>

            <!-- Web development subsection -->
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>My development work focuses on creating clean, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences. I'm passionate about modern web technologies, responsive design, and writing code that is both functional and maintainable. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks to bring ideas to life.</p>

            <!-- Music and creativity subsection -->
            <h3>Music & Creativity</h3>
            <p>When I'm not coding or teaching, you'll likely find me exploring the intersection of music and technology. I'm particularly fascinated by how legendary musicians like Paul McCartney and Geddy Lee have embraced technology to enhance their creative expression. This passion for music often influences my approach to web development, where I see code as another form of creative expression.</p>

            <!-- Philosophy subsection -->
            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>I believe that the best learning happens when we combine structured knowledge with creative exploration. Whether it's writing code, teaching a class, or playing music, I'm driven by the idea that technology should enhance human creativity, not replace it.</p>
