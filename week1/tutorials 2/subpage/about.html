        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm John Smith, a junior computer science student at the University of Texas at Arlington with a passion for web development and user experience design. My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work and has evolved into a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and design. I'm particularly interested in creating accessible, user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems.</p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UTA, where I'm maintaining a 3.7 GPA. My coursework includes web development, database systems, software engineering, and human-computer interaction. I've also completed relevant courses in graphic design and digital media through the university's continuing education program.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests & Goals</h2>
        <p>What excites me most about web development is the ability to create digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. I'm particularly drawn to frontend development and the challenge of making complex information accessible and engaging. My goal is to work as a full-stack developer at a company that values both technical excellence and user-centered design.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy studying design trends, accessibility standards, and emerging web technologies. I believe that great web development requires both technical skill and an understanding of human behavior and design principles.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills & Learning</h2>

        <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I believe that good web development is about more than just making things work â€“ it's about creating experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and delightful for users. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and to contribute to a more inclusive and well-designed web.</p>
