        <h1>CRAP Design Analysis</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Website Analyzed:</strong> Apple.com</p>
        <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com</a></p>
        <p><strong>Date of Analysis:</strong> January 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This analysis examines Apple's website using the CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity). Apple's design philosophy emphasizes minimalism, clarity, and user-focused experiences, making it an excellent case study for effective web design principles.</p>
        
        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <img src="images/contrast-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot showing contrast examples" width="100%">
        <p>Apple's website demonstrates excellent use of contrast through its strategic use of white space, bold typography, and high-quality imagery. The site primarily uses a white background with dark text, creating strong readability. Product images are displayed against clean backgrounds, making them stand out dramatically. The navigation uses subtle gray text that becomes darker on hover, providing clear visual feedback. Call-to-action buttons use Apple's signature blue color, creating strong contrast against the neutral background. This effective use of contrast guides users' attention to the most important elements and ensures accessibility for users with visual impairments.</p>
        
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <img src="images/repetition-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot showing repetition examples" width="100%">
        <p>Repetition is masterfully employed throughout Apple's design system. The same typography hierarchy is used consistently across all pages, with the same font weights and sizes for headings, body text, and captions. Product presentation follows a consistent pattern: large hero images, concise headlines, and brief descriptive text. The navigation structure repeats across all pages, maintaining user familiarity. Color schemes are consistent throughout, using the same palette of whites, grays, and accent colors. Even the spacing and padding around elements follow consistent patterns, creating a unified visual rhythm. This repetition creates a cohesive brand experience and helps users navigate the site intuitively.</p>
        
        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <img src="images/alignment-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot showing alignment examples" width="100%">
        <p>Apple's alignment strategy demonstrates sophisticated grid-based design. All elements are precisely aligned to an invisible grid system, creating order and professionalism. Text content is primarily left-aligned for readability, while centering is used strategically for headlines and product showcases. Navigation elements are perfectly aligned horizontally, and product cards align both horizontally and vertically in organized grids. The consistent alignment creates visual pathways that guide users through the content. Even seemingly simple elements like buttons and form fields maintain perfect alignment relationships with surrounding content. This attention to alignment detail contributes to the site's premium, polished appearance and enhances user experience by creating predictable visual patterns.</p>
        
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <img src="images/proximity-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot showing proximity examples" width="100%">
        <p>Proximity is used effectively to group related information and create logical content hierarchies. Product features are grouped together with appropriate spacing, while unrelated sections are separated by generous white space. Headlines are positioned close to their corresponding body text, establishing clear relationships. Navigation items are grouped logically, with related categories placed near each other. Product specifications and descriptions are positioned close to product images, creating clear associations. The use of white space between sections helps users understand content organization and prevents cognitive overload. This thoughtful use of proximity makes the site scannable and helps users quickly find the information they need.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Apple's website exemplifies excellence in web design through its masterful application of CRAP principles. The strong contrast enhances readability and accessibility, while consistent repetition creates a cohesive brand experience. Precise alignment demonstrates attention to detail and professionalism, and strategic proximity groups related content effectively. Together, these principles create a user experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally superior, demonstrating why Apple's design approach is widely admired and emulated in the industry.</p>
